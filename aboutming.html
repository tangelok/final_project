          <h2>Ming Tsai</h2>
          <p class="about-text">Ming is a James Beard and Emmy award winning chef, author, TV/new media host and producer, product developer, food allergy advocate and East-West lifestyle expert. </p>
          <p class="about-text">Ming's love of cooking was forged in his early years. Ming was raised in Dayton, Ohio, where he spent hours cooking alongside his mother and father at Mandarin Kitchen, the family-owned restaurant. His experience also taught him about restaurant operations and the art of making customers happy. Ming headed east to attend school at Phillips Academy Andover. From there, Ming continued to Yale University, earning his degree in Mechanical Engineering. During this time, Ming spent his summers attending Le Cordon Bleu cooking school and apprenticing at area restaurants in Paris. After graduating from Yale, Ming moved to Paris and trained under renowned Pastry Chef Pierre Herme and then on to Osaka with Sushi Master Kobayashi. Upon his return to the United States, Ming enrolled in graduate school at Cornell University, earning a Masterâ€™s degree in Hotel Administration and Hospitality Marketing.</p>
          <p class="about-text">Ming not only cooks East-West but also lives East-West. Just as his food is all about finding balance and harmony, Ming strives to do that in his daily life. Ming believes that being mindful of Feng Shui and designing one's living and work space within its principles keeps the positive energy flowing. With the original design of Blue Ginger and Blue Dragon, Ming consulted a feng shui master to ensure each space was as positive in its energy flow as possible. Ming regularly receives acupuncture to treat the aches and pains of being a chef and keep himself balanced and healthy. Yoga and frequent squash matches relieve stress, quiet the mind and allow Ming to stay in shape.</p>

        <h3>Blue Ginger</h3>
        <h4><a href="blueginger.html">Click here to learn more about Blue Ginger!</a></h4>
        <p>TIn 1998, Ming opened Blue Ginger in Wellesley, MA and immediately impressed diners from Boston and beyond with the restaurant's innovative East-West cuisine. In its first year, Blue Ginger received 3 stars from the Boston Globe, was named "Best New Restaurant" by Boston Magazine, and was nominated by the James Beard Foundation as "Best New Restaurant 1998". That same year,  Esquire Magazine honored Ming as "Chef of the Year". The James Beard Foundation crowned Ming "2002 Best Chef Northeast" and, since 2002, the Zagat Restaurant Guide has rated Blue Ginger within the "Top 5 of Most Popular Boston Restaurants". In 2007, Blue Ginger received the Ivy Award from Restaurants &amp; Institutions for its achievement of the highest standards in food, hospitality and service. In 2009, Ming and Blue Ginger won IFMA's Silver Plate Award in the Independent Restaurant category recognizing overall excellence in the country. Most recently in November 2012, Boston Magazine ranked Blue Ginger as one of The 50 Best Restaurants.</p>
        <h3>Blue Dragon</h3>
        <p>In early 2013, Ming opened his second restaurant Blue Dragon - an Asian gastro pub located in the Four Point Channel area of Boston. The tapas-style menu features Ming's East-West approach but now takes a twist on traditional pub favorites. Blue Dragon was named one of Esquire Magazine's "Best New Restaurants 2013" and one of Zagat's "24 new restaurants you need to know about around the US".</p>
        <h3>Family Reach</h3>
        <p>Ming serves as the President, National Advisory Board, of the Family Reach organization, a non-profit who's mission is to provide financial relief and support to families fighting cancer.</p>
        <h3>Food Allergy Research and Education (FARE)</h3>
        <p>Ming is a national spokesperson for the Food Allergy Research and Education (FARE), and is proud to have developed the Food Allergy Reference Book. First used at Blue Ginger, the Reference Book is a pioneering system that creates safeguards to help food-allergic people dine safely. For four years, Ming worked with Massachusetts Legislature to help write Bill S. 2701, which was signed into law in 2009. This groundbreaking legislation, the first of its kind in the US, requires local restaurants to comply with simple food allergy awareness guidelines.</p>
